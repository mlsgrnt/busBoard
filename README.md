# busBoard
BVG Berlin realtime departure board using the compass! This is the project I began learning Swift with.

### Would defintely like to see the compass concept used in other more featured transit apps! It was really useful, especially at large stations where scrolling through lots of departures can get really annoying! Just face in the direction that you know the bus will go and that bus will show up at the top. Magical! Algorithm was pretty tricky. Used the coordiantes of the next stop to determine direction. Lots of trig!

Learned a lot about Swift building this project. Went through many iterations and rebuilds from scratch.

#### I am very proud that in an early build I predicted the iOS 13 design paradigm of modals popping up from the bottom!

Later I shifted to a cool push pop animation where the entry expanded to a full view! Sadly I never took a video of this while the app worked. I should've though! I even had this really cool blob view to show all stations which matched the screens in the busses...

Does not work anymore... The API server I built for this was really hastily thrown together and would be a huge hassle to fix.
